- EBS provides block storage in the form of volume – these volumes can be encrypted via KMS
- Block storage is block addressable storage mechanism that uses block IDs to read/write data
- When you attach a volume to EC2 instance, they just see a block storage that can be used to create a file system on top of it
- You generally create an EBS volume and attach it to one EC2 instance using storage network
- These volumes can also be detached and reattached to other EC2 instance.
- EBS are not linked to EC2 instance lifecycle - If EC2 instance moves host, then EBS follows it. If EC2 is stopped or suspended EBS is maintained. It is a persistent storage until you delete it.
- Cluster setting - Some storage types allow multi attach – allowing volumes to attached to multiple EC2 instances
- You can provision EBS volume based on different physical storage types(SSD,HDD) and performance profile
- You are billed GB per month
- It’s an AZ based service
- You can not attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance not in the same AZ
- One or more than one EBS can be attached to an EC2 instance
- EBS replicates data within AZ to provide resilience
- If the entire AZ fails then the EBS also fails even with resilience
- You can provide more resilience by taking volume snapshot and storing it in S3 which is then replicated within all AZs in that region
- This also allows you to create an EBS volume using this snapshot in another AZ in that region or another region.
